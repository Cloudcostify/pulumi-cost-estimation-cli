# Pulumi cost estimation CLI

This tool serves the purpose of ensuring consistent cost estimation in your release (continous deployment) pipeline running Pulumi infrastructure code before deploying cloud resources.
The tool is open source and free to use, fork or modify for both personal and commercial projects regardless of company size.
Selling the source code or direvative works of the code is not permitted however. 
A formal license is under construction. 

A prototype has been created in a C# console application and tested in Azure DevOps pipelines against a test Azure environment. 
Currently there is limited support for select Azure and AWS resources.

I would ‚ù§Ô∏è if you contribute in any way you would like to since I am currently the only one working on the project and it is quite time consuming. 

You can also join the community on slack: https://cloudcostify.slack.com.

The code is currently being prepared to be migrated to the repo.
Set a watch on the repo to get notified when this has been completed or reach out if you want to help speed up the process üòÄ
